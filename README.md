# Summary of business problem and project objective.

## Business Problem
Home Credit is an international consumer finance provider focused on responsibly lending to people with little to no credit history. To continue serving the unbanked, the company needs to confidently and accurately predict which prospective borrowers are likely to repay loans. Accurate loan repayment predictions enable Home Credit to foster financial inclusion while safeguarding the necessary enterprise profitability to sustain its mission.

## Project Objective
This project aims to build a predictive model that evaluates loan repayment capability for individuals with limited or no traditional credit history. A successful model will allow Home Credit to assess applicants based on alternative data, expanding credit access responsibly
